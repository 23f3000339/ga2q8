### Data Overview
- **Q1:** 3.53
- **Q2:** 3.29 (Lowest point)
- **Q3:** 5.74 (Significant recovery)
- **Q4:** 5.05
- **Yearly Average:** 4.4
- **Industry Target:** 4.5

## Key Findings
1. **First Half Struggle:** The year began with sub-par performance, dropping to a low of 3.29 in Q2, well below the 4.5 target.
2. **Q3 Turnaround:** There was a dramatic improvement in Q3 (5.74), suggesting that mid-year interventions were highly effective.
3. **Stabilization:** While Q4 saw a slight regression to 5.05, it remained above the industry target.

## Business Implications
The current average of **4.4** falls just short of the 4.5 target. However, the upward trend in the second half of the year indicates that operational changes are working. The inconsistency in the first half dragged down the yearly average.

## Recommendations
To stabilize the scores above the 4.5 benchmark for the next fiscal year, we must:
1. Standardize the operational changes implemented in Q3 across all departments.
2. Specifically **improve service quality and wait times** in high-traffic triage areas, as these were identified as root causes during the Q1/Q2 dip.
